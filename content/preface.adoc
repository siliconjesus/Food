This is a collection of recipes based on our family recipes going back to at least the thirties or fourties.  Our families hail mostly from Germany -> East to the Russian border (and maybe even over it).  Expect lots of sauerkraut.  You have been warned.  Many of the recipies were refined or adapted once the respective families moved to the US - specficially the Mid Atlantic (Maryland), so crabs are going to be in here even though I personally do not eat them.

Expect some Jewish food, but don't expect it to be kosher.  Some food you can probably find in cookbooks elsewhere (but adapted by us) and plenty that were clipped from the Sunday paper and are now relics to that time many years ago.  Where I can, I'll include the actual recipe cards as well as a marked up transcriptions.  Some recipes I'll include all cards (as we may have different versions) and provide feedback on each.  

Large quantity recipes will be brought down to reasonable sizes where applicable.  Bushel of crabs is a bushel of crabs and how they're generally cooked anyway, but for things like cookies and bread I'll denote some 'normal' sizes since our family tended to make in large batches.

Thanks again for reading, feel free to fork this and I'd love to see your future contributions.
