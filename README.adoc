I am taking this opportunity for me to start documenting all of the recipies I have in many places all 
together again.  This includes family recipies from both myself and my wife's family.  Heavily Eastern European 
and American blended together.  Expect to find a little bit of everything here.

Based off of Circuitswan's repo - using ASCIIDOC for the practice more than anything.
